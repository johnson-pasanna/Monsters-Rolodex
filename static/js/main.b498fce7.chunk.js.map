It's actually easier to test, as we'll see later in the course.

Let's say they want to search people or anything else    We want place to be a prop that gets passed in.And as we learn with our structure, we can d structure that prop off of the props object because all the props come in as one big objects, so let's d structure it off and then pass it into our placeholder\r\n    onChange={handleChange}\r\n  /> //and then on change can be another prop that gets passed in which is a function under the name of handle  change and we'll just structure that one off as well.

This will become much more apparent as we start building larger and larger applications where more of the code gets reused. Right now, the benefits might not be so obvious, but it's definitely the style that we want to codei n.And this is one of the huge advantages of react is writing these smaller and smaller reusable components.\r\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n// import logo from \"./logo.svg\";\n\nimport { CardList } from \"./components/card-list/card-list.component\";\nimport { SearchBox } from \"./components/search-box/search-box.component\";\n\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    //constructor is the code that runs first before anything gets called first\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      //first we hardcoded the mosters name but in real life we will get the data from the backened (server , database etc) we will use a resource where it will give 10 users data without actually building any kind of backended server\n      monsters: [],\n      searchField: \"\",\n    }; // this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\")\n      .then((responce) => responce.json())\n      .then((users) => this.setState({ monsters: users }));\n  }\n\n  handleChange = (e) => {\n    // handleChange(e) {\n    this.setState({ searchField: e.target.value });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const { monsters, searchField } = this.state;\n    const filteredMonsters = monsters.filter((monster) =>\n      monster.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchField.toLowerCase())\n    );\n\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <h1 class=\"logo-font\">Monsters - Rolodex</h1>\n        <SearchBox\n          placeholder=\"search monsters\"\n          handleChange={this.handleChange}\n        />\n        <CardList monsters={filteredMonsters} />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
